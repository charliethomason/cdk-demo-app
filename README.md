# CDK Demo App

Vue demo app that uses [Uptake's Component Development Kit](http://cdk.platform.uptake.com). The Uptake CDK components and Design System styles used in this app I helped to build in part or whole during the time of my employment at Uptake. All Uptake, Component Development Kit, and Design System logos and content are the sole property of Uptake. These components are used here for demonstration purposes only and installed from the public NPM registry.
